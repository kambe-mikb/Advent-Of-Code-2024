# Advent-Of-Code-2024
Advent of Code Solutions 2024 (Golang)

For this year's Advent of Code, I have elected to write my solutions in Go.

I am in the process of learning Go, so some of the choices might be a little
off from accepted best practice. Expect the solution framework to evolve as
I progress.

The *aoc_2024* module uses cobra to manage the CLI.
