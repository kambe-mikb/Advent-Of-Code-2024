any Chief Historians in stock! You're welcome to check the warehouse,
though," says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan
Rental Shop. The Historians head out to take a look.

The shopkeeper turns to you. "Any chance you can see why our computers are
having issues again?"

The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your
puzzle input) is corrupted. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!

It seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers. It
does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each 1-3 digit
numbers. For instance, mul(44,46) multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of
2024. Similarly, mul(123,4) would multiply 123 by 4.

However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also
many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look like part
of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!, ?(12,34), or mul ( 
  2 , 4 ) do nothing.

For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:

xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))

Only the four highlighted sections are real mul instructions. Adding up the
result of each instruction produces 161 (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5).

Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions.`,
